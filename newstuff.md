# I can go to town

# O Canada!
# Our home and native land!
# True patriot love in all thy sons command.
# With glowing hearts we see thee rise,
# The True North strong and free!
# From far and wide,
# O Canada, we stand on guard for thee.
# God keep our land glorious and free!
# O Canada, we stand on guard for thee.
# O Canada, we stand on guard for thee.
